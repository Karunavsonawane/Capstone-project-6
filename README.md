Customer-Segmentation-Project
Customer Segmentation using K-mean Cluster Algorithm



Overview This project implements a customer segmentation model using the K-Means clustering algorithm on an online retail dataset. Customer segmentation is a powerful marketing tool that divides a customer base into groups of individuals with similar characteristics. This enables businesses to tailor their marketing strategies, enhance customer satisfaction, and improve overall business performance.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains transaction data from an online retail store. The key columns in the dataset are:

InvoiceNo: Unique identifier for each transaction
StockCode: Unique identifier for each product
Description: Product description
Quantity: Number of units purchased
InvoiceDate: Date and time of the transaction
UnitPrice: Price per unit of the product
CustomerID: Unique identifier for each customer
Country: Country where the customer resides
Objectives
Preprocess the data to handle missing values, duplicate entries, and data transformations.
Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to gain insights into customer behavior.
Implement K-Means clustering to segment customers based on their purchasing patterns.
Visualize the clustering results and interpret the customer segments.
Preprocessing
Handling Missing Values: Remove rows with missing CustomerID as they are essential for customer segmentation.
Removing Duplicates: Eliminate duplicate entries to ensure data quality.
Feature Engineering: Create new features such as TotalSpent (Quantity * UnitPrice) and aggregate data at the customer level.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Several visualizations were created to understand the data better:

Top Selling Products: Bar chart showing the most frequently purchased products.
Sales by Country: Bar chart illustrating total sales per country.
Number of Orders per Customer: Histogram showing the distribution of order counts among customers.
Distribution of Order Value: Histogram or density plot showing the distribution of total order values.
Quantity Ordered by Customer: Histogram showing the distribution of quantities purchased by customers.
Average Order Value by Country: Bar chart displaying the average order value for each country.
K-Means Clustering
Feature Selection: Selected features relevant to customer segmentation, such as TotalSpent, Quantity, and OrderFrequency.
Scaling: Standardized the features to ensure fair clustering.
Optimal Number of Clusters: Determined the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method and Silhouette Score.
Model Implementation: Applied the K-Means algorithm to segment the customers.
Cluster Analysis: Analyzed the characteristics of each cluster to understand customer segments.
Results and Visualization
Visualizations were created to interpret the clustering results, including:

Cluster Centers: Visual representation of the cluster centroids.
Cluster Distribution: Bar chart showing the number of customers in each cluster.
Cluster Characteristics: Summary statistics and profiles for each cluster.
Conclusion
The K-Means clustering model successfully segmented the customers into distinct groups based on their purchasing behavior. These insights can help the retail store to:

Tailor marketing campaigns to specific customer segments.
Improve customer retention by understanding and addressing the needs of different customer groups.
Enhance product recommendations and inventory management.
